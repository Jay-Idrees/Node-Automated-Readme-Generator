# Node Automated Readme Generator

## About the Project
This project is a command line interface application that prompts the user to answer a series of brief questions, regarding a project and then generates a high quality readme file using Node.js and using the package inquirer. I developed this application during the third week of the coding bootcamp experience at Columbia University, NY. Date of publication: 11/01/2020
