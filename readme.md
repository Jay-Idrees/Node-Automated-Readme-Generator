## About the Project
This project is a command line interface (cli) app that prompts the user to answer a series of questions regarding a project and then generates a high quality readme file using Node.js. I developed this app during the third-fourth week of the coding bootcamp at Columbia University, NY. Date of publication: 11/01/2020
